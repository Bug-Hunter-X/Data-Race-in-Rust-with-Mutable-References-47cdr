This repository demonstrates a common data race error in Rust that can occur when working with mutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code that causes the race condition. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to fix the problem using techniques like cloning, mutexes, or channels to ensure thread safety and data consistency.
